    <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h1>
    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency -
        could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
    <p>
        IT tools have so many benefits to efficiency and productivity for example simply using the internet can give you
        solutions to almost any problem near instantly. Using websites like MDN to quickly understand new code or syntax
        is a good way to improve productivity as you are learning how to write new code while still working.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>
    <p>
        One way to improve productivityand efficiencyis to try and block out all distractions for example people talking
        or loud background noise like people typing. you can avoid these in a couple of ways, wearing headphones, moving
        somewhere quieter or politely asking them to try and keep the noise down.

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently
        next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
    <p>
        Next time I do something like this I would definitely consider working as a team more using Slack and Trello to
        better organise workflow. I would also make more use of the space around me to try and avoid distractions
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>
        To test digital solutions I would first run a debug to make sure all of my code is working as intended, I would
        then open my website and make sure all of its features work and are in the correct place making sure every
        button takes the user to the correct place.
