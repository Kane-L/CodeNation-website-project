        of
        communicating with employees, suppliers and customers. A lot of companies also use different systems for
        stock
        tracking and management.

        how
        it helps their website succeed, look at how you can improve and integrate it into your own website. you can
        also
        look at websites that weren't successfull and see what they did that could have caused it to not become as
        successfull so you can avoid these same mistakes. i would also use my Trello board to help me organize the
        tasks
        i need to complete.

    <h3>1.4 describe risks that might impact digital projects. what causes projects to fail.</h3>
    <p>
        There are a couple of mistakes that are commonly made while making digitial projects that can cause them to
        fail, for example: over complicating it and pottentionaly making it intimidating to users or contrarily you
        could over simplify it and lose users due to it being too dull or lacking in features present in similar
        websites. There are also multiple reasons a project could fail that are less predictable such as corruption,
        missuse and malware just to list a couple that can break a project and cause it to need completely rebuilt.

        how
        their choices benefit their website and what benefits other options would provide and choose the option with
        the
        most relevent benefits for the website I am creating. I would also trial some diferent systems/software to
        see
        which i find easiest to work with and which ones perform best in my own opinion.
