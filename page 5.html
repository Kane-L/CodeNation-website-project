    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h3>
    <p>
        copyright is a very big thing to consider when making a website as one copyright claim can ruin your website and
        potentialy cost you a lot of money depending on who is claiming copyrightand what they are claiming is
        copyrighted. Another constraint that affects websites is the GDPR (general data protection regulation) is one of
        the biggest considerations to be made when making a website that requires personal data from its users for
        example social media websites and online shops. If websites dont follow GDPR and properly protect users personal
        info hackers could break into the website and steal the info and use it for any number of reasons from taking
        money from accounts to identity theft.

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may
        face when using webpages and how we can overcome them?</h3>
    <p>
        Accessability is incredibly important for websites for example people who are colour blind or completely blind
        still need to be able to use the website. Many websites use features like alternate colour gradients for colour
        blind users and audio descriptions of whatever the mouse is hovering over allowing blind users to navigate the
        website. If a website does not have accessability features it is limiting its user base as anyone with a
        disability that requires.

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h3>
    <p>
        HTML files, most websites are HTML files. CSS files, most html files use CSS to make them look nicer. Jpeg
        files, Jpeg files are pictures. I have used all of these files have been used on this website at some point.
        there are many more filetypes such as: MIDI sequenced music files made on keyboards, TIFF high quality images,
        AVI Standard video format, PDF Portable Document Format, PNG a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs
        and MP3 a sound file format which is highly compressed. These are all appropriate filetypes.
