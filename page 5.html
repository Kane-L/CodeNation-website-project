    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h3>
    <p>
        copyright is a very big thing to consider when making a website as one copyright claim can ruin your website and
        potentialy cost you a lot of money depending on who is claiming copyrightand what they are claiming is
        copyrighted. Another constraint that affects websites is the GDPR (general data protection regulation) is one of
        the biggest considerations to be made when making a website that requires personal data from its users for
        example social media websites and online shops. If websites dont follow GDPR and properly protect users personal
        info hackers could break into the website and steal the info and use it for any number of reasons from taking
        money from accounts to identity theft.
