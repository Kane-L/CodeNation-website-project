    <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy
        with the tools you used?
    </h3>
    <p> While making my website I used VS code and trello and I am happy with using these tools as they helped me keep
        everything organised and helped me to focus on specific tasks where normally I would be a lot more sporadic in
        my approach which often leads to me missing things. I also used CodePen to practice and test out code i wasn't
        sure about which helped me to learn different uses for pieces of code.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.
    </h3>
    <p>The tools I used where appropriate for me as they are easy enough for someone who has never done any coding to
        get their head around while also being deep enough for me to try new ideas and experiment with what works and
        what doesn't and how to try and make it work. Overall I am hapy with how my website is coming together so far,
        it is not perfect and given enough time i feel i could improve it a lot more and make it look alot nicer than it
        currently is but thats for when i understand CSS and HTML more.</p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h3>
    <p>
        Overall I am happy with my website i feel that with more time to get to know CSS and HTML I could make it much
        better with more features like drop down menus and other user friendly features that will make my website look
        better and be nicer to use.
    </p>
    <div></div>
    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.
    </h3>
    <p>I could improve the overall look of the website as it is rather bland at the moment, for example i could add drop
        down menus for navigating the website, I could also edit the buttons to make them move with the screen and
        overall look better on the website.</p>
